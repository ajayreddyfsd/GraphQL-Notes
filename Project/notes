## Index.js

1. **Import specific things first**.
2. **Wrap `ApolloProvider` around the App component**.

---

## Context vs GraphQL

- Earlier, we were using **React Context** to get the data.
- Now, we will be using **both GraphQL and Context**.

---

## `categories.context.js`

- We use `useQuery` to run GraphQL queries.

```javascript
//! Run the GraphQL query using useQuery()
//? Where is GraphQL getting the data from?
//? It gets it from the backend. The backend already has the data, which we have not coded ourselves.
//? The instructor already coded the backend, so we are just using it.
//? Once the backend is ready, we can query and use `useQuery()` like this.


we can also get-data or mutate-data directly from inside the component
```

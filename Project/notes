in index.js, first import specifc things

and then wrap apploo provider around app comp

now earlier, we were context to get the data right, now we will be using gql and context both

categores.context
we use useQuery

//! Run the GraphQL query using useQuery()
//! Run the GraphQL query using useQuery()
//? but where is GraphQL getting the data from? from the backend, backend has the data, which we have not coded yet
//? instructor already has backend coded, so we are using it.
//? so once backedn is coded, we can query and useQuery() like this.

usage is same has normla context usage
importing useContext and the specific context

can also get data directly through gql inside comp instead of context
can also modify or mutate data directlt from inside comp instead of context

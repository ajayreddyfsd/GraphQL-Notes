in Mdb, we have db, collections and docs
collections just have name
and inside collections there are docs which are just json object




but in Gql, there is no DB is first place
also, 
collections and docs are in a single json with collection-id and collection-title
so, collections itself is a json doc with id, title and also the json docs




examples :
----------
